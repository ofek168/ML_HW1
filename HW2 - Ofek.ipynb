    "\n",
    "For this assignment, you will be developing an artificial neural network to classify data given in the __[Dry Beans Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Dry+Bean+Dataset#)__. This data set was obtained as a part of a research study by Selcuk University, Turkey, in which a computer vision system was developed to distinguish seven different registered varieties of dry beans with similar features. More details on the study can be found in the following __[research paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168169919311573)__.\n",

    "## About the Data Set\n",
    "Seven different types of dry beans were used in a study in Selcuk University, Turkey, taking into account the features such as form, shape, type, and structure by the market situation. A computer vision system was developed to distinguish seven different registered varieties of dry beans with similar features in order to obtain uniform seed classification. For the classification model, images of 13611 grains of 7 different registered dry beans were taken with a high-resolution camera. Bean images obtained by computer vision system were subjected to segmentation and feature extraction stages, and a total of 16 features - 12 dimensions and 4 shape forms - were obtained from the grains.\n",
